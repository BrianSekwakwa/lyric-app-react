<h2>Recipe Finder</h2>

A react application that searches for food recipes from the food2fork API 

<h2>What I learned</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Getting to use axios package to fetch data from the API</li>
  <li>Learning about react router. Learning how to use the BrowserRouter, Switch, Route, Link from react-router-dom</li>
  <li>Learned that gh-pages doesn't play well with BrowserRouter so I had to use HashRouter instead</li>
</ul>
